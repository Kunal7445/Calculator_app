## ✨ Key Features

- Perform calculations based on user input  
- Supports multiple calculation types (length, width, height, radius-based computations)  
- Saves user input and preferences between sessions  
- Responsive and interactive UI using EditText, Spinner, and Buttons  
- Logging and debugging support for accurate results

## 🛠 Technology Stack

**Programming Language**  
- Java  

**Platform**  
- Android Studio  

**UI Components**  
- EditText, Spinner, TextView, Buttons  

**Data Handling**  
- SharedPreferences for persistent user input

## 🧩 Application Design

The application follows a modular design where the UI components interact with a `Logic` class that handles all calculations. The app uses object-oriented principles for modularity, maintainability, and scalability.  

Event-driven programming is used to respond to user input and button presses, while SharedPreferences ensures data persistence across sessions.
